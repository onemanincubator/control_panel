Description
===========
This plugin provides an admin control panel for handling adminish
type stuff. It integrates with my plugin crud. Right now I'm using
it only for CRUDing database records from an admin point of view.

Just kidding. But not really. Point is, this code sucks. Breaks pretty 
much every unwritten rule of proper Rails coding. I won't bore you 
with the details.

Don't bother looking in the code. As I said, it sucks.

So why post it on github? Because I couldn't figure out how to manage
this code using git with the shared codebase sitting on my local 
machine while still using capistrano to deploy. github is a no-brainer.

Someday, when this plugin code becomes beautiful, I'll write up a
proper README. But for now, just move along. :)
